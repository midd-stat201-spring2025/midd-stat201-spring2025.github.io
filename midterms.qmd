## Midterm 1

### Logistics

-   **When and where**: Thursday, 3/13/25 during class (75 minutes)

-   **What**: content through end of Week 4 (i.e. through Simpson's Paradox)

    -   This includes homework and coding practices
    -   The midterm will be done entirely in a `.qmd` that will be made available to you at the start of class 11:15am on 3/13. The midterm ends at 12:30pm, but you will have an extra 5 minutes to render the assignment and submit to Gradescope. If your submission is not in by 12:35pm, you will receive an automatic 25% penalty.
    -   Non-coding concepts are also fair game for the midterm!

-   **Important**: Prof. Tang will be proctoring the exam

    -   However, Prof. Tang will *not* help de-bug code or fix rendering issues.

-   You will not have a problem set assigned this week!

-   Friday 3/14 office hours will be moved to Wednesday 3/12 3:15-4:15pm instead.

-   This midterm will be open note in the sense that your notes, my slides, and your homework/coding practices are all available to you.

### Preparation

-   The best preparation you can do for the midterm is to go through your homework and coding practices and be honest with yourself about what you do/don't understand. This means going through the painful process of looking at feedback on Gradescope. For the concepts that you need to practice more, try more problems (see below)!

-   Just because the midterm is open note, this does not mean you cannot study and prepare. You will not have time to try and re-learn what all the functions we learned do!

    -   I suggest going through each of the `ggplot` and `dplyr` functions that we've seen in the course and ensuring you know how they work and when to use them!

-   For extra practice, additional coding problems are made available below. These questions are not necessarily representative of the typical scope and difficulty of individual exam questions. This review is not comprehensive, nor does it represent the expected amount of time for it will take for you to complete the midterm.
