-   No office hours tomorrow

-   Daylight savings this weekend

-   Data collection proposal due Monday 11/4 midnight!

## Recap

-   Test for difference in two proportions

    -   Learned about $\hat{p}_{pooled}$

-   Test for a single mean

    -   $z$-test: we know $\sigma$, use standard Normal distribution

    -   $t$-test: we don't know $\sigma$, use $t$ distribution

# CI for paired mean

## Paired data

Suppose we have two sets of observations/data $\boldsymbol{x} = (x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots x_{n})$ and $\boldsymbol{y} = (y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{n})$

-   The data are considered **paired data** if each $x_{i}$ corresponds to exactly one $y_{i}$

-   Example: your score on the midterm and your score on the final

-   When analyzing paired data, we are typically interested in the difference in outcomes of each pair of observations

## Paired differences

-   Let $d_{i} = y_{i} - x_{i}$ for each $i = 1,\ldots, n$ be the observed differences

-   The $d_{i}$ come from larger population with true mean difference $\mu_{d}$ and standard deviation of differences $\sigma_{d}$

-   The sample mean difference and sample standard deviation of the differences are

::: fragment
$$\bar{d} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{i} \qquad \qquad s_{d} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (d_{i} - \bar{d})^2 $$
:::

## CLT for mean difference in pairs

-   Suppose the $n$ observational units are independent and the distribution of the differences is approximately normal. Then CLT says:

    $$
    \bar{d} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N\left(\mu_{d}, \frac{\sigma_{d}}{\sqrt{n}} \right)
    $$

-   We are usually interested in performing inference for $\mu_{d}$ when both $\mu_{d}$ and $\sigma_{d}$ unknown

-   Our formula for $\gamma\times 100\%$ CI for $\mu_{d}$ is analogous to the formula for one mean when $\sigma$ unknown:

::: fragment
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{point estimate} &\pm t^*_{df, (1+\gamma)/2} \times \widehat{\text{SE}} \\
\bar{d} &\pm t_{df, (1+\gamma)/2}^* \times \frac{s_{d}}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{align*}
$$

where $df = n-1$

## Example: zinc

```{r}
zinc <- data.frame(bottom = c(0.430, 0.266, 0.567, 0.531, 0.707, 0.716, .651,	.589,	.469,	.723),
                   surface = c(.415,	.238,	.390,	.410,	.605,	.609,	.632,	.523,	.411,	.612))
```

Data consist of measured zinc concentrations in bottom water and surface water at 10 randomly sampled wells:

# CIs for difference in two means

## Difference of two means

Now consider two populations under the condition that the data/populations are not paired.

We might be interested in learning about whether or not the means of each population are equal (think about the voice jitter homework problem)!

-   Let $\mu_{1}$ and $\mu_{2}$ represent the population means for the two populations 1 and 2

-   Samples of size $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ from each population, respectively

-   We might think it reasonable to use $\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}$ as a point estimate for $\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}$

## Conditions for inference

Now that we have two populations, conditions for CLT and use of the $t$-distribution for inference will look slightly different:

1.  **Independence** (extended): need data within *and* between the two groups

    -   e.g.the two data sets come from independent random samples or from a randomized experiment

2.  **Normality**: we need to check for approximate normality for *both* groups separately

## CI for difference in two means

If the conditions hold, then our usual formula for $\gamma \times 100\%$ CI still holds:

$$
\text{point estimate} \pm \text{critical value} \times \text{SE}
$$

1.  Point estimate

```{r}

## Example: C02 concentrations

-   The Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii of monitors atmospheric solar, atmospheric, and meteorological parameters

-   Continuous measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (C02) began in March 1958

-   We have data on annual atmospheric C02 concentrations from 2000-2015.

-   We will conduct a hypothesis test to see if the average atmospheric C02 levels (ppm) from 2000-2015 is different from 350 ppm.

```{r}
co2 <- read_csv("data/co2_annmean_mlo.csv") |>

## Example: voice shimmer

Let's consider the voice shimmer of PD vs non-PD patients from last week's homework.

```{r}
url_file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/midd-stat201-fall2024/midd-stat201-fall2024.github.io/refs/heads/main/data/parkinsons.csv"
parkinsons <- read_csv(url_file)
x_pd <- parkinsons |>
  filter(status == "PD") |>
  pull(shimmer)
x_healthy <- parkinsons |>
  filter(status == "Healthy") |>
  pull(shimmer)
n1 <- length(x_pd); n2 <- length(x_healthy)
xbar1 <- mean(x_pd); xbar2 <- mean(x_healthy)
s1 <- sd(x_pd); s2 <- sd(x_healthy)
```

Set-up/find the following:
:::

1.  Point estimate
2.  Standard error
3.  Code for critical value

## Example: voice shimmer (cont.)

```{r}
#kableExtra::kable(birth_sum, digits = 3)
point_est <- round(xbar1 - xbar2,3)
se <- round(sqrt(s1^2/n1  + s2^2 / n2), 3)
df <- min(c(n1-1, n2-1))
t975 <- round(qt(0.975, df), 2)

ci <- round(point_est + se * t975 * c(-1,1), 3)
```

1.  Point estimate: $\bar{x}_{\text{PD}} - \bar{x}_{\text{H}} = `r round(xbar1, 2)` - `r round(xbar2,2)` = `r point_est`$

2.  SE $\approx \sqrt{\frac{s_{\text{PD}}^2}{n_{\text{PD}}} + \frac{s_{\text{H}}^2}{n_{\text{H}}}} = \sqrt{\frac{`r round(s1,2)`^2}{`r n1`} + \frac{`r round(s2,2)`^2}{`r n2`}} = `r se`$

3.  Critical value:

    -   $df = \min\{n_{\text{PD}} -1, n_{\text{H}} -1 \} = \min\{`r n1` - 1, `r n2`- 1\} = `r df`$

    -   Want $0.975$-th percentile of $t_{`r df`}$ distribution: `qt(0.975, df =`r df`)` = `r t975`

:::: fragment
::: discuss
Putting everything together, our 95% CI for $\mu_{\text{PD}} - \mu_{\text{H}}$ is: $$
`r point_est` \pm `r t975` \times `r se` = (`r ci`)
$$

-   Interpret this CI in context. Note: direction of difference matters!

# Hypothesis test for mean paired difference

## Paired data (recap)

-   Recall paired data: we have two set of data $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$ where each $x_{i}$ has a corresponding to one $y_{i}$

    -   Can obtain differences $d_{i} = y_{i} - x_{i}$

    -   We are interested in the true mean difference $\mu_{d}$

-   Recall: if observational units are independent and the differences are approximately Normal, then CLT gives us:

::: fragment
$$
\bar{d} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N\left(\mu_{d}, \frac{\sigma_{d}}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
$$
:::

-   We don't typically know $\sigma_{d}$, so replace with sample $s_{d}$ (and then use $t$ distribution)

## Hypothesis test

-   Hypotheses: $H_0: \mu_{d} = \mu_{0}$ versus $H_{A}: \mu_{d} \neq \mu_0$ (or $>$ or $<$ )

-   Obtain summary statistics $\bar{d}_{obs}$ and $s_{d}$

-   ::: discuss
    Check if CLT holds. If so, what is our **null distribution**?
    :::

::: fragment
$$
\bar{d} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N\left(\mu_0, \frac{\sigma_{d}}{\sqrt{n}} \right)
$$
:::

-   ::: discuss
    Because we don't know $\sigma_{d}$, our **test statistic** here is:
    :::

::: fragment
$$
t = \frac{\bar{d}_{obs} - \mu_0}{\frac{s_{d}}{\sqrt{n}}} \sim t_{df}
$$

where $df = n-1$
:::

## Example: zinc (revisited)

```{r}
zinc <- data.frame(bottom = c(0.430, 0.266, 0.567, 0.531, 0.707, 0.716, .651,	.589,	.469,	.723),
                   surface = c(.415,	.238,	.390,	.410,	.605,	.609,	.632,	.523,	.411,	.612))
```

Data consist of measured zinc concentrations in bottom water and surface water at 10 randomly sampled wells:

::: {style="color: maroon"}
Do the data suggest that the true average concentration in the bottom water is greater than that of surface water? Let's now answer this using a hypothesis test at the 0.05 level.
:::

-   ::: discuss
    Define parameters and hypotheses
    :::

    -   Let $\mu_{d}$ be the true mean difference between zinc concentrations (bottom-surface)
    -   $H_{0}: \mu_{d} = 0$ versus $H_{A}: \mu_{d} > 0$

-   Last week, we saw conditions for CLT were satisfied

## Example: zinc (cont.)

```{r echo = T}
zinc <- zinc |>
  mutate(d = bottom - surface)
d_bar <- mean(zinc$d)
d_bar
s_d <- sd(zinc$d)
s_d
```

```{r}
n <- nrow(zinc)
d_bar <- round(d_bar, 4)
s_d <- round(s_d, 3)
se <- round(s_d/sqrt(n), 3)
t <- round((d_bar - 0)/(s_d/sqrt(n)), 3)
df <- n-1
p_val <- round(1 - pt(t, df), 3)
```

::: discuss
Find the test-statistic
:::

## Example: zinc (cont.)

::: fragment
$$t = \frac{\bar{d}_{obs} - \mu_{0}}{s_{d}/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{`r d_bar` - 0}{`r s_d`/\sqrt{`r n`}} = `r t`  \sim t_{`r df`}$$
:::

-   So our p-value is $\text{Pr}(T \geq t) = \text{Pr}(T \geq `r t`) = 1 - \texttt{pt(`r t`, `r df`)} = `r p_val`$

-   We reject $H_{0}$! The data provide convincing evidence that zinc concentrations of bottom well water is greater than those of surface water.

# Hypothesis test for difference in means

## Sampling distribution for difference in means

-   Two populations, interest in $\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}$ (or other order)

-   Samples of size $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$

-   If CLT holds, we learned sampling distribution of difference in sample means is:

::: fragment
$$
\bar{X}_{1} - \bar{X}_{2} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N\left(\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}, \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{n_{2}}} \right)
$$
:::

-   When we don't know the population standard deviations, we replace the $\sigma$ with $s$ and use a $t$ distribution

-   Same thing will happen for hypothesis test!

    -   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
        Same conditions for inference: independence (extended) and approximate normality/large sample size (extended)
        :::

## Hypothesis test

Hypotheses $H_{0}: \mu_{1} = \mu_{2}$ versus $H_{A}: \mu_{1} \neq \mu_{2}$ (or $>$ or $<$)

-   If CLT holds, our **null distribution** for the difference in sample means is:

::: fragment
$$
\bar{X}_{1} - \bar{X}_{2} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N\left(0, \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{n_{2}} }\right)
$$
:::

-   ::: discuss
    In practice, use $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$. So our **test-statistic** is...
    :::

::: fragment
$$
t= \frac{\text{point est} - \text{null value} }{\widehat{\text{SE}}_{0}} = \frac{(\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}) - 0}{\sqrt{\frac{s_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{s_{2}^2}{n_{2}}}} \sim t_{df}
$$

where $df = \min(n_{1}-1, n_{2}-1)$
